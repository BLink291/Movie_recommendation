# What is this repository?

In this project, we attempt to understand the different kinds of recommendation systems and
compare their performance on the MovieLens dataset. We attempt to build a scalable model
to perform this analysis. We start by preparing and comparing the various models on a
smaller dataset of 100,000 ratings. Then, we try to scale the algorithm so that it is able to
handle 20 million ratings by using Apache Spark. We find that for the smaller dataset, using
user-based collaborative filtering results in the lowest Mean Squared Error on our dataset.
